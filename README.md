# city-lookup-react

A city information app built using TDD 

# Description 

Using the Teleport API, this app will allow you to enter a city into the input.

Information as scores out of 10 will be returned, such as Cost of Living and Commute. 

Eventually, other features will be added: two input fields to compare cities, search autofill, onHover to explain how scores are calculated. 

This app is being built using Test Driven Design as a guiding principle.
